Background:
The original was created by Joel Wasserman at https://github.com/joelwass/Android-BLE-Scan-Example.
After reviewing a lot of different examples and tutorials on BLE scanning I was very impressed by its simplicity.

Scope form Joel Wasserman:
This is a simple example app that turns on BLE and scans for devices, listing them out. It's for Android (M) API 23
Built in Android Studio with gradle system. The app scans for nearby BLE devices and displays them in a TextView.
